# Blinkit-Analysis-using-Python

## Project Objective
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations in Python.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/afrasumi0112-byte/Blinkit-Analysis-using-Python/blob/main/blinkit_data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Tools Used
- Python(Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## KPI's Requirements
- Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
- Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
- Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
- Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold.
### Chart Requirements
- Total Sales by Fat Content:
 ##### Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
 ##### Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
 ##### Chart Type: Donut Chart.
- Total Sales by Item Type:
 ##### Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
 ##### Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
 ##### Chart Type: Bar Chart.
- Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: 
 ##### Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
 ##### Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
 ##### Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.
- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:
 ##### Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
 ##### Chart Type: Line Chart.
- Sales by Outlet Size:
 ##### Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
 ##### Chart Type: Donut/ Pie Chart.
- Sales by Outlet Location:
 ##### Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
 ##### Chart Type: Funnel Map.

## Process
- The data is cleaned and preprocessed using python libraries.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Different python libraries are used to clean and visualize the data according to the KPI's requirements.

## Project Insight
- Larger outlets in Tier 3 locations are major sales contributors,possibly due to higher customer traffic or larger store sizes.
- Brands and store planners should pay more strategic attention to medium-sized outlets,which form the dominant segment.
- Store age does not linearly impact sales. Newer outlets might not always outperform older ones. Investigating renovation,location, or brand policies across the years cvould explain the variation
- In all tiers,Low Fat products consistently outperform Regular ones in total sales aligning with modern consumer preferences for healthier products.
- Stocking up on high demand categories like Fruits and Vegetables can drive overall outlet sales.
  
 ## Final Conclusion
 Focus on expanding and upgrading medium and Tier 3 outlets,increase inventory and promotions for Low Fat products and maintain a robust supply of top performing categories like Fruits and Vegetables
